The AI engineer successfully built a personal apartment booking website from scratch, following strict technical and design guidelines. The initial phase focused on setting up a full-stack application using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, adhering to specific environment variable and routing rules (e.g.,  prefix for backend routes, no hardcoding URLs). After clarifying user requirements for booking details and payment, the engineer rapidly deployed a functional MVP, utilizing  for initial code generation. Subsequent efforts primarily involved debugging issues identified by a testing agent, specifically addressing price calculation errors, calendar display nuances, and critical MongoDB  serialization problems (transitioning to UUIDs). The core booking flow, including date selection, price display, and total calculation, is now fully operational and validated through testing. The next explicit task is integrating Stripe for payments.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to create a personal apartment rental booking website to bypass platforms like Airbnb. The site needs to be complete, accessible, and intuitive for managing reservations for a single apartment. Key features include a simple booking system without user accounts, capturing guest name, email, phone, number of people, number of nights, and arrival time range. The system should allow for modulating night-by-night rates and include optional additional fees and a security deposit (to be discussed). An online payment system (Stripe) is desired. The application has been built with an interactive calendar, elegant property presentation, and a comprehensive booking process. The current implementation successfully handles date selection, calculates the total price based on nightly rates (€120/night), and displays a booking summary.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React**: Frontend framework for interactive UI.
- **FastAPI**: Backend framework for API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Shadcn UI**: Pre-built, customizable UI components for React.
- **Environment Variables**: For secure configuration (e.g., , ).
- **Kubernetes**: Containerized deployment environment.
- **UUIDs**: Used for MongoDB document IDs to ensure JSON serializability.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a full-stack setup within the  directory, containing distinct  and  components.



- ****:
  - **Summary**: This is the main FastAPI application file handling all backend logic. It sets up the MongoDB connection, defines API routes, manages data storage (bookings), and includes the price calculation logic.
  - **Changes**: Initial creation via . Subsequent edits (via ) were made to fix  in price calculation, ensure correct handling of dates, and critically, to change MongoDB document IDs from  (ObjectId) to UUIDs for JSON serialization compatibility as identified during testing. It also includes CORS middleware configuration.

- ****:
  - **Summary**: The core React component responsible for the entire user interface. It renders the property display, the interactive calendar (using Shadcn's ), the booking form, and displays the calculated total price and booking summary. It interacts with the backend via API calls using .
  - **Changes**: Initial creation via . Edits were made to correct price display issues, ensure the calendar correctly interacts with booking logic, and accurately reflect booking summaries after backend calculations.

- ****:
  - **Summary**: This file contains specific component styles and Tailwind CSS overrides, contributing to the functional but beautiful UI as per the guidelines.
  - **Changes**: Initial creation via  to establish the base styling for the application's layout and components.

- ****:
  - **Summary**: This file includes global Tailwind CSS directives (, , ) and defines the application's color palette using CSS variables, crucial for implementing Shadcn UI's theming.
  - **Changes**: Provided as part of the initial project structure, it defines the base styles and color variables for light/dark themes.

The application leverages  in the frontend and  in the backend, ensuring no hardcoded URLs, and all backend API routes are prefixed with .

<current_work>
Currently, the AI engineer has completed the foundational build of the apartment booking website. The user interface, built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components, elegantly presents the apartment information. A fully interactive calendar allows users to select check-in and check-out dates. The frontend correctly sends booking requests to the FastAPI backend, which then calculates the total price based on a €120 nightly rate. The booking summary dynamically updates, showing selected dates and the accurate total amount (e.g., 3 nights × €120 = €360).

All critical bugs identified during initial testing have been addressed. Specifically,  issues in price calculation were resolved, ensuring the backend returns correct values. Calendar display issues have been clarified; the calendar correctly disables past dates for the current month. Crucially, the issue with MongoDB  being non-JSON serializable has been fixed by adapting the backend to use UUIDs for booking IDs, ensuring seamless data transfer between backend and frontend. The application is now in a state where users can successfully navigate, select dates, receive accurate price calculations, and view a booking summary.
